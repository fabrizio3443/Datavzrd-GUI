# Datavzrd GUI

**An open-source desktop GUI that makes it easy for non-technical users to install, configure, and use [Datavzrd](https://github.com/datavzrd/datavzrd).**

## Overview

Datavzrd GUI is a community-built desktop application that wraps the power of the [Datavzrd CLI](https://github.com/datavzrd/datavzrd) in a clean and intuitive interface. It aims to allow users ‚Äî especially those unfamiliar with the command line ‚Äî to work with data transformations, configuration files, and outputs more easily and visually.

Built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), this app is lightweight, cross-platform, and fast.

## Disclaimer

This is an **independent community project** created by Fabrizio.dev. It is **not officially affiliated with or endorsed by the Datavzrd maintainers**.

The goal of this GUI is to complement the official CLI by providing a more accessible experience for users who are less familiar with command-line tools.

Please refer to the official [Datavzrd repository](https://github.com/datavzrd/datavzrd) for core project updates and support.

## Why This Exists

The CLI version of Datavzrd is powerful, but configuring and running it can be challenging for non-technical users ‚Äî especially those unfamiliar with YAML, Conda, or terminal commands.

This GUI lowers the barrier to entry, making Datavzrd accessible to data professionals, analysts, and enterprise users who prefer visual tools.
